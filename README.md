# River 

- The instalation process is for Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS xenial version
- Also, note that the process is described for all of our tools not just RIVER.
- You can download Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS from here (take 64-bit) : http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/

# Steps setup 

## End-user Workflow:
0. Be sure you install the latest cmake version first. The version tested was 3.14.
1. Save the installRiverTools.sh file to your home directory ("~/")
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AGAPIA/river/master/installRiverTools.sh
```
2. Download an unzip The prebuilt-Z3 libraries https://fmiunibuc-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ciprian_paduraru_fmi_unibuc_ro/EUBDz3URzcBAjzEslzE8LfYBEoR0uwKubUoIweqTSuJeRg?e=3jmRPT to ~/z3 folder (such that path ~/z3/Debug/lib/libz3.so exists).
3. Make sure you don't have anything important in folder "~/testtools" because that folder, if exists, will be removed.
4. From command line run for example:  
```
sh ~/installRiverTools.sh testtools Debug
```
First parameter is the folder to install all River tool. This command will install all in ~/testtools/ . You can of course change the folder name as you wish
Second parameter is for build type and it can be either Debug or Release

Now you have to close the terminal and open it again (to activate the env variables) to see if it works !


## Test tracer functionality

Test simpletracer on the basic fmi experiments lib:
```
python -c 'print ("B" * 100)' | river.tracer -p libfmi.so
``` 

More details about the parameters:
```
$ river.tracer --payload <target-library> [--annotated] [--z3] < <input_test_case>
```
**--annotated** adds tainted index data in traces


**--payload \<target-library\>** specifies the shared object that you want to trace. This must export the payload that is the tested sw entry point.

**--annotated** adds tainted index data in traces

**--z3** specified together with `--annotated` adds z3 data in traces

**\<input_test_case\>** is corpus file that represents a test case.

## Experiments 
If you want to see live how logs react to your changes:
1. Go to /home/YOURUSERNAME/testtools/river/benchmark-payloads/fmi and change the code inside fmi.c 
2. Run: ./test_build.sh to build and install the lib
3. Run ./test_inference.sh to test on a given payload input (edit the input payload inside the script if you want)
  Notice the file libfmi_dissassembly.txt created for you to understand the ASM code used by River. You must follow only the one in test_simple function ("search for the string in that file).

## Programmers workflow:
Asside from the things defined above, you can incrementally test your build by running:
```
~/testtools/river/a_buildtools.sh testtools (Debug or Release) [clean].
```
The last parameter , clean, is optional, only if you want to rebuild everything.

## Debug using Visual Studio Code

The modern way to debug and build projects from VS code:
```
  a. Install VS code using ~/installVsCode.sh script. 
  b. Open vs-code as administrator: sudo code --user-data-dir="~/.vscode-root"
  c. Install C++ , native debugging and cmake extensions
  d. Open the folder of any solution you want to debug and use Cmake status bar to build/debug 
  NOTE: For simpletracer use a GCC compiler in the Cmake interface toolbar
```
  
Below is the old version of how to debug from VS code
``` 
  a. Install VS code using ~/installVsCode.sh script.
  b. Open vs-code as administrator: sudo code --user-data-dir="~/.vscode-root"
  b. Install C/C++ extentions (there are 2) C/C++ 0.21.0 and C++ Intellisense 0.2.2
  c. File->Open folder ~/testtools/simpletracer
  
  To build the code: just press CTRl+SHIFT+B  and you'll see the log in Terminal window inside vscode.
  To install the libs and perform a full rebuild: press CTRL+SHIFT+P, write Run Task then choose "build_full".
```
```
